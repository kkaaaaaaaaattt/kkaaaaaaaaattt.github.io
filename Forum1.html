<h1 style="text-align: center">Accessibility</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">Accessibility is how easily something is to use or obtain, or Kairos, a Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy defines it as “access and usability for digital publishing”. I never really thought about how inaccessible it is for some disabilities to read, hear, or use the computer. For the blind, companies are coming out with new revelations to help the disabled to get the content they need as if they didn’t have a disability. For example, newspaper companies are publishing their articles online so they can have a read option. The point of having a “read” option is so that “blind people can use computers and access any text content through the computer…without being dependent on other people… [because] software programs read the electronic text out loud” (Web Aim). This makes it more accessible for them, less expensive, and less dependent on someone else. For other disabilities such as motor disabilities, there have been special keyboards made, using other techniques to type, or even eye-tracking software. I think a good technique that is not mentioned in the Web Aim article is the voice recognition most smart phones and computers have where you can speak to the device and give it a command.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"> Important Issues to Keep In Mind</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Some of the most important issues of accessibility that web writes need to be aware of are how sensitive some material can be to certain people, or how it maybe be inaccessible for people. For example in Kairos, they explain how they have “taken a very minimalist approach to design the webtext, keeping images, colors, and typographic features sparse. This could be having minimal pictures because images cannot be read for people with disabilities whom cannot see clearly, or maybe those who are colorblind and if someone is colorblind, you do not want to have your entire webtext colors that are more commonly unable to see which will also need to be taken account in when making the text-to-hypertext project. Also, for the more sensitive route, you want to be sure that your images or graphics, words, etc are not going to be sensitive to others. For example, emoji creators have come out with a gazillion new emojis in every gender and skin color (i.e. the two dads with the two kids, or the many skin-colored Santas). In the BBC radio talk, How do blind people interpret emojis?, they have audio that reads to them what emoji it is. They had talked about the thumbs up emoji being read as “thumbs up sign with medium/ dark skin tone”. Those who created the title name for the emoji want to be sure they aren’t going offend someone perhaps by the color of the emoji by saying ‘thumbs up sign with brown skin’ because that could be offensive.</p>
