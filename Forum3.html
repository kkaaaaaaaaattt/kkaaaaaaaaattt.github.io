<h1 style="text-align: center">Movement and Navigation for an Informational Site</h1>
<p style="text-align: center"> An informational website I find myself using quite often is IMDb.com. I use this website often because during movies or TV shows I get curious as to what actor plays a certain role, or maybe where they're from originally, what other movies they're in, etc. This website is very useful because it is "content-rich with few words" (Redish, 74). As Redish lists, this website portrays the six basic functions that she provides as a good homepage: Be findable through search engines, identify the site, set the site's personality/ inspire trust, help people get a sense of what the site is about, continue the conversation quickly, and send the audience in the right direction. IMDb is a very clear, navigable website that is easy to trust and understand. It's very straight-forward and provides a voluminous amount of information while still using the "bite, snack, meal" approach (Redish, 134-135). IMDb uses this approach by (I searched Hacksaw Ridge since this is what I am watching at the moment): </p>
<p style="text-align: center"> Bite (headline, link, brief description, etc): Once searched, the headline says "Hacksaw Ridge (2016). In the designated headline area, there are also five links above the headline/title that takes you to "Full Cast And Crew" (which is where I usually look at), "Trivia", "User Previews", "IMDbPro", and "More". When clicking on any of these links (I'll use "Full Cast And Crew"), it navigates you to a very straight-forward page within the website with "Directed by", "Writing Credits", and "Cast" with a picture, their name, and their character in the movie. The headline area also gives very short descriptions about the movie (i.e. R rate, 2h 19 min, Drama, History, War, and 8.3/10 star rating).  </p>
<p style="text-align: center"> Snack (brief summary): Under the headline area, there is a brief description about the movie that consists of one sentence describing the entire movie (which is very detailed and basically covers the whole movie). Under this explains the director, writes, and the leading roles of the movie. There is also the trailer for this area which is roughly a larger summary of the movie. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"> Meal (details): The meal section of the Hacksaw Ridge's IMDB page contains video clips from the movie, interviews, photos, a "People who liked this also liked..." section, the cast overview (which shows the main characters), the Storyline and plot summary, plot keywords, taglines, genres, motion picture rating, details which contains box office details, credits, etc, Frequently Asked Questions, User Reviews, etc. The meal section also contains connecting links to all of the other links that are written in the headline ( i.e. Full Cast And Crew). </p>
<p style="text-align: center"> Strategies that websites can rely on to help get users where the need to go is chunking (Meyer), avoiding category names that suck (Loranger), and just an overall good navigation. In Meyer’s article on chunking, she summarizes chunking as “a concept that originates from the field of cognitive psychology… professionals can break their text and multimedia content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand, and remember it better” which also leads into Loranger’s article in avoiding sucky names. You want something to stand out and to be visible and presentable so people will not forget the site or article, etc that was searched for. For example, Meyer uses the word “chunking” rather than rather than just using words like summarizing or condensing or outlining. She uses a term that has a stronger meaning rather than just an everyday word that comes up in common conversation. When you have something catchy, it helps you remember when you’re trying to think of it again or explaining it to someone else. I know Dr. Andrews said not to use these sorts of sites for examples, but a catchy title, I believe, doesn’t have to be just a title. We also remember things by pictures, colors, font styles, etc. So in example, if you don’t remember the word “Pinterest”, if you explain the symbol for the site, someone is bound to know what you’re talking about. </p>
