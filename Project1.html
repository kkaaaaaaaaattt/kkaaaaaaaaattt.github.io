<p>I am a biomedical major with a premedical concentration at <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/"> Texas A&M University- Corpus Christi</a>. I hope to get into medical school, preferably at UT Southwestern, but I will also be applying to Texas Tech, Baylor, LSU, and Oklahoma University. I am hoping one day to become a surgeon.</p>
<p> Some things about me: I'm from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pflugerville,+TX/@30.4549009,-97.6683966,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644cdb4ff71844f:0xc811047b64becbe0!8m2!3d30.4393696!4d-97.6200043">Pflugerville</a>, a city outside Austin. I'm originally from Orange County, California but I'm most definitely a Texas girl. I currently live in my chaotic home in Corpus Christi with my four roommates, our five dogs, a cat, and a fish while my boyfriend is deployed. Once he comes back, it'll be just the two of us and our big 100lb fur-child. I also work at the university in the IT department, and work at Saltgrass as a server. </p>
<p>Some of my hobbies and interests includes movie/ Netlix watching, fitness and health, playing with my German Shepard pup, crafting and painting, and anything outdoorsy! </p>
