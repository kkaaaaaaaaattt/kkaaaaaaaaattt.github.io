<p style="text-align: center">For my reflection on the Codeacademy Modules, I’m going to make it like a pro-con list just because I don’t want to favor the pro or favor the con of this project!</p>


<p style="text-align: center">Cons:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I think the worst part about the Codeacademy is that I starting doing the wrong modules. I only got to 34% of the other one, but once I hit some kind of frustrating glitch in the system, I emailed Dr. Andrews about it and was informed that I was doing the wrongs ones. My mistake. Now I just need to learn to fully read directions…For the modules we were supposed to do, they were long and tedious mainly because certain things were so precise and I did not understand where they were going in the index or html. Unlike the wrong modules I was doing, it didn’t give me the code once I got overly frustrated I just kept clicking the “Submit Code” button thinking it would eventually change its mind on my wrong endeavors so it took me 30-45 minutes trying to figure out somethings. Some sections of the modules I just gave up and came back to it a few hours later after resetting the codes, which was also frustrating because some of the codes were quite long. I think what would’ve helped me was using my resources within the modules and going back to the start where it would show you something similar to what you were creating. Therefore, if I was stuck, I could go back and see how it was written. Another thing that was outstandingly frustrating was learning how to do the GitHub. The first time I messed it up… then the second…third time is always a charm. The GitHub that was given to us made it 100x easier, although I did get extremely confused halfway through because it was giving us his GitHub index.html code. What was confusing was trying to turn it around to make it with my name and my items. Took me a few tries. The whole GitHub part of this assignment was just a mess for me. I figured it out eventually after a few emails and thirty something tries. Let’s just come to the conclusion that I am not so techy at this stuff.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Pros:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">I really did like this project although I wasn’t very good at figuring the little things out. It was a very fun assignment because after we followed the instructions, you got to create things that are your own with your own colors and fonts and pictures. Peep at my clickable photo page if you really like puppies swimming underwater, but I am not going to lie, my links for it are terrible. After I got the hang of the assignment, it was a breeze in some sections and I like to mess around with the different things you could do with it and find short cuts when I couldn’t figure out the actual code it wanted me to put (sneaky, sneaky!!!). I think my favorite module on this assignment was either the clickable photo page or the resume. I know the resume was super basic, but I really like changing and messing with my resume to make myself sound cooler than I am, so it was fun to move things around and make it super un-detailed. But the clickable photo page. ? Did you see all the underwater puppy pictures? ? I was a little upset, however, that I couldn’t find a German Shepard pup in the mass of photos I looked through (and I looked through a lot!!!). I really did like this assignment aside from all the problems I had during it.</p>
