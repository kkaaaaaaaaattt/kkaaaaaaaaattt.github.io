<p style="text-align: center">I really liked this project. It was very confusing at first and I was clueless on how to go about the project, but it got easier as I figured it out. When I started thinking about the project, it had a whole thought process in my head of what I was going to do and what I wanted it to look like. Then I was going to do the heard route and make everything from scratch. I came across Wix, which allowed me to start from scratch, but not a completely white canvas. It was very useful. I went through some of the examples on the site and mashed a bunch of ideas together.

<p style="text-align: center">I liked this project because I am a creative person, and this let me put my creativeness on a different kind of media. I liked how we took a random paper and turned it into something lively. Overall, this project was a great idea, and let students be creative with their own mind. It was a “this is what I want you to do, now do whatever you want” kind of project. It was nice that not all of our projects will be the same, or probably even have the same topic. It was nice that one of those stupid college essays was turned into something interesting.</p>
